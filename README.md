# IsogramGame
Basic Text Based Game To Demonstrate Programming In C++ 

## The Requirement:-

> inputs

- off course we need string input
- all lower case, right length and isogram,
- we need the tries number as an input with int type.
- we need hidden number.
- we need to check if that has non repeating words.
- we can check the hidden world length should not cross the length of word given by the user

> output

- if the give worl length is long than hidden word than show error
- if user enter numbers show errors
- we show bull = 5, cow = 2 like this 
- we show you won if all the character matches with the hidden word

> taks user need to do

-> guess the hidden word within X times.


> any performance limies worth mentioning?

-> since, it's a console based game we won't have any performace issue , i meaning we can
but we prevent them with some of the edge cases.

> what assets do we need? (art, sound, story text etc.)

-> well well well we don't need any of those but just a little bit of graphics to
show that the game has an image at all.


> Possible future ideas (The NO List):-

-> Give feedback on every key press. shake screen if two character occur
-> have a large dictionaty of hidden words.
-> user selectable word length, and difficulty.
-> checking the user's guess is a dictionary isogram.
-> maybe we can provide a time limit for the guesses.

**REMEMBER: if a solution is a house than project is like a room in that house.**
